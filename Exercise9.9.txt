What Does Each Code Snippet Do?)

    Assume the following method call is in an overridden earnings method in a subclass:

     super.earnings()

    Assume that the following line of code appears before a method declaration:

     @Override

    Assume the following line of code appears as the first statement in a constructorâ€™s body:

     super(firstArgument, secondArgument);

ANSWERS

1. super.earnings()
    This code snippet calls the earnings() method of the superclass from within an overridden earnings() method in a subclass. 
    It allows the subclass to execute the implementation of the earnings() method defined in the superclass, in addition to 
    any additional functionality or modifications implemented in the subclass.

2. @Override
    This annotation is used in Java to indicate that a method is being overridden from a superclass. 
    When placed before a method declaration in a subclass, it ensures that the method signature matches a method in the superclass. 
    If there is no matching method in the superclass, or if the signature does not match, a compilation error occurs.

3. super(firstArgument, secondArgument);
    This code snippet invokes a constructor of the superclass from within a constructor of the subclass. 
    It is typically used to initialize the inherited members of the subclass using parameters passed to the constructor of the subclass. 
    This line must appear as the first statement in the constructor's body, and it is used to explicitly call 
    a constructor of the superclass with specific arguments.
